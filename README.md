# Pacman in Pascal

Programming assignment in the first semester of my computer science studies: Pacman programmed entirely in the good old Pascal. More specifically, it uses Free Pascal in Lazarus IDE and ZenGL library for GUI, controls and sound.

The beautiful noodle-imperative source code can be found in `pacman.lpr` (but written in Czech:/)
